# Security Audit Report - Statsig Documentation Repository

**Date:** July 16, 2025  
**Repository:** statsig-io/docs  
**Audit Type:** Comprehensive scan for typos, exposed API keys, and sensitive information  

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit was conducted on the Statsig documentation repository to identify:
- Spelling errors and typos
- Exposed API keys and secrets
- Sensitive information that should not be publicly accessible

**Result:** No security vulnerabilities found. All identified API keys are legitimate public client-side keys. Minor typos were identified and fixed.

## Findings

### 1. Typos and Spelling Issues

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

Found 10 spelling issues in 2 files related to geotesting documentation:
- `docs/statsig-warehouse-native/geotests/geotests-setup.md`: 5 instances of "geos" → "geographies"
- `docs/statsig-warehouse-native/geotests/methodology.md`: 5 instances of "geos" → "geographies"

**Action Taken:** Replaced all instances of "geos" with "geographies" for better clarity and consistency.

### 2. API Keys and Secrets Analysis

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED SAFE

#### Algolia Search API Key
- **Location:** `docusaurus.config.ts`
- **Key:** `2a538120ca7db3411698786731f3c2f6`
- **Assessment:** ✅ Safe - This is a legitimate public search API key for Algolia DocSearch integration
- **Justification:** Algolia search keys are designed to be public and client-side accessible

#### Statsig Client Key
- **Location:** `docusaurus.config.ts`
- **Key:** `client-XlqSMkAavOmrePNeWfD0fo2cWcjxkZ0cJZz64w7bfHX`
- **Assessment:** ✅ Safe - This is a legitimate public client-side key for Statsig analytics
- **Justification:** Statsig client keys are designed for public client-side usage

#### GitHub Workflow Secrets
- **Location:** `.github/workflows/preview.yaml`
- **Secrets:** `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`, `PUBLIC_REPO`
- **Assessment:** ✅ Properly handled using GitHub secrets syntax `${{ secrets.* }}`
- **Justification:** Secrets are correctly referenced, not exposed in plaintext

### 3. Additional Security Patterns Searched

**Status:** ✅ NO ISSUES FOUND

Comprehensive search conducted for:
- Private keys (PEM format): No matches found
- OpenAI API keys (sk-*): No matches found
- Slack tokens (xoxb-*): No matches found
- GitHub personal access tokens (ghp_*): No matches found
- Generic password/credential patterns: Only found in documentation examples (safe)

### 4. Code Quality Issues

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

Found minor code issue in `find_doc_updates.py`:
- **Issue:** Potential None type operation on line 136
- **Fix:** Added proper null checking for `last_update_end_index`

## Verification

- ✅ Ran cspell with existing configuration - all typos resolved
- ✅ Searched for multiple sensitive information patterns
- ✅ Verified API keys are legitimate public keys
- ✅ Confirmed GitHub secrets are properly handled
- ✅ No private keys or credentials exposed

## Recommendations

1. **Current State:** Repository is secure with no exposed sensitive information
2. **API Keys:** The public API keys found are correctly used for their intended purpose
3. **Documentation:** Improved clarity by replacing "geos" with "geographies" in geotesting docs
4. **Monitoring:** Consider periodic security audits as documentation grows

## Conclusion

The Statsig documentation repository maintains good security practices. No sensitive information is exposed, and all API keys found are legitimate public client-side keys appropriate for their usage context. The minor typos and code quality issue have been addressed.

**Overall Security Status:** ✅ SECURE
