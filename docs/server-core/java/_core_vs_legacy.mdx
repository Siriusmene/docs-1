## Java Core vs Legacy Java SDK

Statsig offers two Java SDKs:

1. **Java Core (Recommended)** - A newer, performance-focused SDK with a shared Rust core library
2. **Legacy Java/Kotlin Server SDK** - The original Java SDK

### Key Differences

| Feature | Java Core | Legacy Java SDK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Performance** | 5-10x faster evaluation | Standard performance |
| **Dependencies** | Requires OS/architecture-specific native libraries | Pure Java implementation |
| **New Features** | Supports Parameter Stores, SDK Observability, streaming flag changes | Limited to basic features |
| **Implementation** | Rust-based with Java bindings | Pure Java |
| **Repository** | [statsig-server-core](https://github.com/statsig-io/statsig-server-core/tree/main/statsig-ffi/bindings/java) | [java-server-sdk](https://github.com/statsig-io/java-server-sdk) |

### When to Use Each SDK

**Choose Java Core if:**
- Performance is a priority for your application
- You need the latest features like Parameter Stores
- You're starting a new implementation

**Choose Legacy Java SDK if:**
- You have an existing implementation using the Legacy SDK
- You prefer a pure Java implementation without native dependencies
- You need specific features only available in the Legacy SDK

### Migration

If you're currently using the Legacy Java SDK and want to migrate to Java Core, follow these steps:

1. Update your dependencies to use the Java Core library
2. Replace imports from `com.statsig.sdk.*` to `com.statsig.*`
3. Update initialization code to use the new format
4. Test your application thoroughly to ensure compatibility
