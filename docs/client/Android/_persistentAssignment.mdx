### Persistent Assignment

For experiments and layers, you can ensure that a user consistently receives the same variant throughout the duration of the experiment or layer, even if targeting rules or allocation changes.

This is accomplished using the `keepDeviceValue` parameter when calling `getExperiment()` or `getLayer()`.

```kotlin
// Ensure user stays in the same experiment group
val experiment = Statsig.getExperiment("new_user_promo", keepDeviceValue = true)

// Ensure user stays in the same layer group
val layer = Statsig.getLayer("user_promo_experiments", keepDeviceValue = true)
```

When `keepDeviceValue` is set to `true`, the variant a user receives is stored locally on the device. In subsequent evaluations, the SDK will return the stored variant rather than re-evaluating the experiment, ensuring user experience consistency.

For more details on persistent assignment, see the [Client Persistent Assignment](/client/concepts/persistent_assignment) documentation.
