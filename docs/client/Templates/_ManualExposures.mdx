## Manual Exposures <VersionBadge version={props.addedInVersion}/>

:::warning
Manually logging exposures can be tricky and may lead to an imbalance in exposure events. For example, only triggering exposures for users in the Test group of an experiment will imbalance the experiment, making it useless.
:::

<>
  Added in version {props.addedInVersion}, you can now query your
  gates/experiments without triggering an exposure as well as manually logging
  your exposures.
