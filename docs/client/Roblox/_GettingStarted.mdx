## Initialize the SDK

After installation, you will need to initialize the SDK using a Client SDK key from the ["API Keys" tab on the Statsig console](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys).

These Client SDK Keys are intended to be embedded in client side applications. If need be, you can invalidate or create new SDK Keys for other applications/SDK integrations.

:::info
Do NOT embed your Server Secret Key in client-side applications, or expose it in any external-facing documents. However, if you accidentally expose it, you can create a new one in the Statsig console.
