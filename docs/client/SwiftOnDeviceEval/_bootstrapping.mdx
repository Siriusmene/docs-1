## Bootstrapping

You may wish to bootstrap the SDK with local values, or from a server integration.  This would provide default values in the case where the network is completely unavailable, or prior to a successful network request.

Often, this is implemented as a local file that is bundled with your application, and provided to the SDK during initialization.

You can get a copy of your current config file from the cdn here: https://api.statsigcdn.com/v1/download_config_specs/{YOUR_SDK_KEY}.json

```swift
import StatsigOnDeviceEvaluations

 // (optional) Configure the SDK if needed
let opts = StatsigOptions()
opts.environment.tier = "staging"

let specs: NSString = "..." // JSON string of your configurations

let error = client.initializeSync("client-sdk-key", initialSpecs: specs, options: opts)
if let err = error {
    print("Error \(err)")
}
```
