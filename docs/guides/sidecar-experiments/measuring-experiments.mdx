## Using Autocapture
Sidecar comes loaded with Statsig's web analytics autocapture feature that automatically tracks various web activities, allowing you to create both simple and complex metrics within the Statsig console without writing a line of code.

For detailed information about autocapture events and their properties, see the [Web Analytics Events documentation](/webanalytics/events).

## Using the tracking API

You can track events manually for actions that are not autocaptured by the feature described above. 
To track events back to Statsig, you can call `StatsigSidecar.logEvent` which takes the same arguments as the Statsig JS SDK as documented [here](/client/deprecated/jsClientSDK#event-logging). This method can be called prior to completion of the init routine. 

```js
// example order event
StatsigSidecar.logEvent('Order', null, {
  total: 54.66,
  units: 3,
  unitAvgCost: 18.22
});
```

## Post-Experiment Callback for outbound integrations
You can bind a callback that gets invoked after Sidecar has run experiments (also gets called when there are no experiments), 
allowing you to run code that processes the experiment assignments as needed.

_This method should be defined anywhere prior to the Sidecar client script._

```js
window.postExperimentCallback = function(statsigClient, experimentIds) {
  /** 
   * add your own callback routine here
   * ie; annotating 3rd party analytics tools with assignment info
      
    var evarValue = [];
    experimentIds.forEach(function(expId) {
      var inExp = statsigClient.getExperiment(expId, { disableExposureLog: true }).groupName;
      if(inExp) {
        evarValue.push(expId + ':' + inExp);
      }
    });
    evarValue = evarValue.join(',');
   */
}
```
