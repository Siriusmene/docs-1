# SDK Health Hub Warnings

The SDK Health Hub helps you identify and resolve common issues with your Statsig SDK implementation. This page explains the warnings you might see in the Health Hub and provides solutions for each issue.

## Detecting Initializations

Initialization is the step in SDK setup where your SDK downloads the values for your set of Flags(Gates), Experiments, Dynamic Configs, etc., and prepares itself to log events. In all SDKs, initialization entails calling a method like `.initialize()` - with occasional naming variation between SDKs (e.g., `InitializeAsync` in javascript). 

:::tip How to solve
If you're using a less common SDK (.NET, Dart, Unity, PHP), or an older version, it's possible that this section can appear incomplete erroneously. Otherwise - all you need to do is initialize your SDK - see the [docs for the SDK you're using.](/sdks/getting-started)
:::

## Initialization Success

Initialization success is the percent of initialization attempts that the SDK is making that are successfully returning values from the Statsig servers. 

:::warning How to solve
Common issues on client SDKs include:
- Adblockers
- Poor network conditions
- Attempts to initialize/updateUser happening without a network connection (common with backgrounded Android apps)

If you suspect adblockers, consider setting up a [proxy](/custom_proxy/). 

Server issues are less common but may include:
- Improper networking restrictions in your cluster
- Unsuccessful use of a custom initialization approach (like an improperly configured data adapter)

Inspecting specific error logs where your Server SDK is running is likely to yield more information on the issue.
:::

## Initialization Size

As you add more gates, experiments, and dynamic configs to your project - the size of your `initialize()` payload will grow. On client SDKs, the initialize payload is "evaluated," meaning it'll have only the results for a single user in the payload, but on Server SDKs - this'll contain the set of rules defining the results for all users.

:::tip How to solve
- Archive stale gates and experiments
- Limit the size of any dynamic configs you use
- Consider using [Target Apps](/sdk-keys/target-apps/) to limit the configs that any one client/server key can retrieve
:::

## Initialization Time

Initialize is served from CDNs on Statsig's Server SDKs, and our servers for Client SDKs. Initialize time is largely driven by clients' network conditions, but initialize size can also contribute.

:::tip How to solve
Consider the advice above for reducing your initialize size.
:::

## Detecting Config Checks

Any time you call `.checkGate`, `.getExperiment`, `.getDynamicConfig` or similar in the Statsig SDKs, a "check" event is sent to our servers to help you see usage of your configs, and understand user allocation to experiments. If you're using Statsig's gates, experiments, or dynamic configs in your app, you should see data in this field.

:::warning How to solve
Issues with exposure data can include:
- **Client SDKs**: Data loss due to adblockers or when users are immediately redirected after a "check"
- **Server SDKs**: Process exits before events are sent (typical in serverless situations)
  - Solution: Call `.shutdown` or `.flush` on the SDK before exiting
- Accidentally disabling exposure logging on your checks or in the StatsigOptions
- Misconfiguring an event logging API in StatsigOptions
:::

## Config ID Presence

Every config (gate, experiment, or Dynamic Config) in Statsig has an ID type that is used to randomly bucket users into groups. When that ID is absent from your "checks", Statsig can't accurately bucket those users (they'll all be placed in the same bucket, perhaps unbalancing your experiment).

:::tip How to solve
- Inspect your code paths to ensure that the ID type you're using is the correct one for where you're running the experiment
- For logged-out experiments, an anonymous identifier like StableID is most appropriate
- For a quick fix, add a targeting gate to an experiment, filtering out any users with a null ID type
:::

## Healthy Evaluation Reasons

When you check a Statsig gate/experiment/dynamic config - the SDK will always provide a value, to ensure your customer experience is unaffected even if something goes wrong. Instead of panicking when something hasn't worked quite right - the SDKs expose "Evaluation Reason" as a key source of information for if the SDK is in a healthy state when you make checks. Reasons are discussed in detail in our [debugging docs](/sdk/debugging#evaluation-reason).

:::warning How to solve
Depending on the evaluation reason, solutions differ:

- **`uninitialized`, `unrecognized`, `novalues`, `loading`**
  - Review your [Initialization Strategy](/client/concepts/initialize)
  - Common issues:
    - Forgotten initialization call
    - Checking configs before initialization completes
    - Successful initialization doesn't have values for the user object

- **`error` or `unsupported`**
  - Update your SDK version, as you're attempting to use a rule type your SDK doesn't support

- **`bootstrapstableidmismatch` or `invalidbootstrap`**
  - See our [debugging guides](/sdk/debugging#faqs) for these issues

- **`noclient`**
  - You might be trying to check a config outside of the \<StatsigProvider\> in React
:::

## Detecting Events

In Statsig, you can use the `.logEvent()` method in any SDK to create metrics that support your experiments. Without events - Statsig's functionality is limited, and we won't be able to perform experiment analysis, or use Metrics Explorer. If you're using Statsig Warehouse Native, this section might appear empty.

:::tip How to solve
If you already have a source of events, you can:
- Import them with one of our [Integrations](/integrations/introduction)
- Use a data import from your [warehouse](/data-warehouse-ingestion/introduction)

Otherwise, start tracking your events with `.logEvent()` in your code.

Common issues:
- Misconfigured StatsigOption (like disableAllLogging)
- Not calling `.flush` or `.shutdown` before your process exits (common in serverless applications)
:::

## Event ID Presence

For an event to be useful in Statsig, it should have at least some IDs attached to it - like userIDs, stableIDs, or other customIDs that you can set. Some SDKs have typing that forces at least one ID to be included, but others don't.

:::tip How to solve
Ensure that your user objects have at least one ID on them, or acknowledge that they'll be unusable in experiment analysis.
:::

## Latest Versions

We're constantly updating Statsig's SDKs with performance, security and functionality improvements. We encourage you to always monitor and bump your SDK versions. While we only sometimes publish official end-of-life notices for SDK versions, we encourage you to stay on a version that is at most 6 months old.

:::tip How to solve
Visit your [SDK reference](/sdks/getting-started) to find the latest version.
:::

## Client Bootstrapping

[Client Bootstrapping](/client/concepts/initialize#2-bootstrap-initialization) is a method to use Server SDKs to provide initialization values to client SDKs. Along with performance benefits (this request can be parallelized with other requests your client makes, reducing load times), client bootstrapping improves resilience in the case of a Statsig outage, as Server SDKs have continual, uninterrupted access to rulesets. 

:::tip How to solve
Visit our [guides on client bootstrapping](/client/concepts/initialize#2-bootstrap-initialization) to assess if it's the right initialization strategy for you.
:::

## Target Applications

[Target Applications] help you filter the gates/experiments/dynamic configs that any one SDK key can access. This has performance benefits - like improving your initialize performance by reducing your payload sizes, but also can have privacy benefits for your application - like the ability to limit visibility of server-targeted configs to the frontend.

:::tip How to solve
Visit the [Target Apps page](https://console.statsig.com/settings/apps) on console to set up your first target apps.
