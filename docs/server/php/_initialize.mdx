There is also a parameter `options` that requires you to pass in a storage adapter for storing configurations and event logs. In this below example, we use a local file storage adapter, but you can write your own to plug in Redis or another storage solution. Create an adapter that implements `Statsig\Adapters\IConfigAdapter` if you do not want to use the local file storage adapter.

:::caution
#### v3.0+
You must setup ConfigAdapter and ensure configs are ready before initialize SDK. SDK does not make any network request call to download configs (and IDLists) anymore. 
Config fetching should be handled by a job that runs out of band, and pre-initialization.  The default implementation here suggests a local file and a cron job, but you can implement an adapter in your stack to use redis/a caching layer and some sort of scheduled job to keep it up to date.
:::

```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php'; // path to installation folder

use Statsig\StatsigServer;
use Statsig\StatsigOptions;
use Statsig\Adapters\LocalFileDataAdapter;
use Statsig\Adapters\LocalFileLoggingAdapter;

$config_adapter = new LocalFileDataAdapter();
$logging_adapter = new LocalFileLoggingAdapter();
$options = new StatsigOptions($config_adapter, $logging_adapter);
$this->statsig = new StatsigServer("server-sdk-key", $options);
```

### ðŸ”¥ Warning - You need a job to update the config definition ðŸ”¥

:::caution
#### V3.0+
If you do not configure a job that keeps your config definition up to date, the SDK does not fire a network request to fetch the latest config value anymore.  Config values fetched earlier will be used.
:::

By default, we document how to do this using a local file and [Cron Jobs](#cron-jobs).  You can implement an adapter in your stack to use a caching layer and some sort of scheduled job to keep it up to date.
